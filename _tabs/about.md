Welcome to my blog! My name is Pedro Caseiro, and I'm a Portuguese geek who enjoyed so much exploring the internet, 
and the art of making software when I was very young, which eventually it became my job.

I used to make games in [Engine001](https://001gamecreator.com/) and [RPG Maker](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/), the true
early days of no/low-code platforms :)

As I continued to learn more about coding, both for local computing and web development, I began to **create websites 
for the local community from 2008** onwards. I also created an **online community** that produced regular content 
about technology, gaming, and other entertainment areas, with a customized point system to motivate the community to share.

Not long after I made some plugins for [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/) in another **gaming community** where I
was a member and eventually became an **administrator/vice president** while also doing a lot of the maintenance and 
configuration of our **infrastructure**.

This last experience alone gave me a lot of insight into how to **maintain live systems** that have to respond in **real-time**. 
I got the chance to learn some more **web development** being used daily by thousands of players/visitors, where I also
learned the importance of **cybersecurity**. To this day, I haven't found any company that was under as much attack as this 
community. We were expelled from multiple data centers due to being targeted!

From **2011 onwards**, I started investing in **my own infrastructure, including VPS, Dedicated Servers, and even 
collocation in the Netherlands**! I hosted my own gaming servers, my forums, my chat communities, and then 
later **started my own web hosting business**, which I discovered was a very saturated market.

In **2014**, I **started working full-time in software engineering** for a company and then started freelancing. After a while, 
I figured that software engineering was not only about "making things work" and decided it was a good idea to work 
full-time in companies that could help me grow while **pursuing a computer engineering degree** to strengthen my skills and 
learn about the fundamentals that I was lacking, which I'm proud to say that I finished in 3 years.

I also completed the **first year of the Master's degree in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics**, which gave me even
better insights into that world, but I decided that the time and money investment in the thesis wasn't worth the title,
so I left it at that. At the time, I was investigating the usage of **neural networks, mainly LSTMs**, to detect cheating 
behavior in real-time in games like CS:GO. I didn't go too far, but I had the chance to learn a lot about the state of 
the art of machine learning.

As you may have noticed, I enjoy playing games, working on personal projects, and pursuing **personal growth** as a person.
In this last point, I've been doing some volunteering for a while at a local food bank-like association.

I'm a curious learner, and **I hope to encourage you to be one too**. Feel free to contact me through Twitter or Email if 
you have any questions, suggestions, insights to share.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find my blog helpful and thought-provoking!
