Having worked at multiple startups and small companies one thing that I understood overtime is that FOCUS is the most important asset you can manage.

You can burn through a lot of cash building the "perfect system" just to find out that you ran out of money because you didn't iterate fast enough.


## The Trifecta: Quality vs Scope vs Time

Having worked on codebases that would take 1 month average for a simple change and working now on a codebase that got that down to 1 or 2 days, I can tell you that the difference is night and day.

The main difference is quality. But with quality I mean one main thing - the ability to change/extend the codebase without breaking things.

With quality, I don't mean 100% edge cases covered, 100% performance, etc. That belongs in the scope category.

The scope of a feature is not only what it does, but also its limitations, and sometimes product teams need help understanding that there are decisions to be made there.

With high quality (meaning time to change is low) and very small scopes we guarantee that we can iterate fast.


## Thinking of an example

Let's say you're building a feature that allows a backoffice user to

Code quality is one of the most important


Focus 






- premature optimization
- future thinking is future garbage
- impact of decisions in future usage
- making decisions without enough data
- replace planning the future with allowing for change
- delay decisions until you have enough data
- the company stage is very important to make decisions
- robustness is an attribute,
