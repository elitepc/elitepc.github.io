I believe that software engineering is all about creating systems that serve people. 

While the code we write is important, it's the human interactions that truly make our work meaningful.

Through sharing my personal views on past events and key takeaways from my experience as a software engineer with over 
8 years of experience, I aim to provide insight on how to navigate through problems you may encounter in your career.

I'll be reflecting on past situations that I can now see with greater perspective, and also document the lessons 
I've learned along the way.

My goal is to encourage engineers to embrace a culture of continuous learning, while also providing technical 
insights for those in other roles who may be interested in expanding their knowledge on these topics.
