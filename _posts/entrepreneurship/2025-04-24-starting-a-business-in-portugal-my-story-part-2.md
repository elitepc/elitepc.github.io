You gotta love being kicked in the nuts every day to stay afloat.

I understand this is not just a portuguese perspective, but god-damn it's hard to find reliable people that actually assume responsibility.

So much shit since my last post:

- I've discovered that the building I rented didn't have the necessary permits for the business I needed
  - The guy from the real estate agency basically lied multiple times about it and then lied to the owners saying that I checked everything with the city, which would be impossible in those time frames
- I had to switch to another architect
- I had some vinyls installed, they took too long, they didn't achieve what was requested (block of the light), we can notice the bubbles from a bad application
  - They charged almost 2.6k€ for a badly executed job, and now they want 1k€ more to fix it
- Agreed with some people to take care of the social media, and they are kind of just waiting, had to post it myself after waiting 20 days for something to happen after first contact
- The LED lighting outside of the building doesn't properly light the purple letters at night
  - Tried fixing this, changed the LED lighting, still not ok
- Painting plastics with fluorescent colors is being a pain in the ass
- Orders missing items
- Owners not providing the documentation I need to proceed with permits
- Getting injured


But also we've made some good progress:

- All courses basically finished
- Girlfriend now supporting me more
- Half the courses basically painted
- All lighting on top done
- We have a plan to license this
- We have most stuff ready to go
- Some more social media traction and some requests for reservations


All in all, it's not too bad. I'd like to be open for business by now, but that's not really possible. I'm really trying to aim for mid-May, but let's see.

One thing is for certain, I'm 100% scouting for talent, paying attention to those 1% that actually move the world and don't just sit on the benches watching.
